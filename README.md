# **Java Comment Separator**
This project uses regular expressions (regex) to analyze and parse comment lines in Java source code files. The project identifies single-line, multi-line, and Javadoc comments, and saves them into separate files. The CommentLines class keeps track of the count of each type of comment and writes the comments to appropriate files. The FileReader class reads the source file line by line and calls the methods of the CommentLines class to process the comments. Regex expressions ensure accurate detection and parsing of comment lines. As a result, comments are written to the appropriate files, and a summary of the comments' counts is displayed on the screen.
